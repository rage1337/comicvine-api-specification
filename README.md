This repository holds the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification for the [ComicVine API](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/). This specification is a **work in progress**, as such it is not yet complete and accurate.

The main repository is hosted on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/guillaumedsde/comicvine-api-specification) and a mirror on [Github](https://github.com/guillaumedsde/comicvine-api-specification).

This repository's CI pipeline automatically validates the specification and publishes it on [Gitlab Pages](https://guillaumedsde.gitlab.io/comicvine-api-specification).
It also generates and publishes a [Python API client](https://github.com/guillaumedsde/comicvine-api-specification) from the specification.
